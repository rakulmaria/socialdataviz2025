# Testing out if LaTex works

The purpose if this exercise was to get an idea of how jekyll works and to host a website. I succeeded in this part.

I now want to test out if LaTex works correctly, as I have made changes to the `_layouts/post.html` style. Let's see: $$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$. Wohoo! It successfully works.

This project was developed as part of the course [02806 Social data analysis and visualization](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02806) taught at DTU in spring 2025 by [Sune Lehmann](https://sunelehmann.com/about/). The project was my final exam project for the course, where I seeked to investigate something super interesting.
